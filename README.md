# Recurring Donor Churn Prediction and Cohort Analysis

### Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance monthly revenue for a (non-profit) Digital Fundraising Team by bolstering the retention rate of recurring donors. For instance, implementing targeted email campaigns to recurring donors or individuals in specific interest areas identified by the predictive model to prevent churn. For this sample, it is projected that targeting the predicted churners would boost monthly revenue by $5,000 on average.

### Part 1
Conducted cohort analysis to explore retention rate trends among recurring donors.
Key Insight: Currently, only approximately 30% of recurring donors (in this sample) remain retained two years post-donation initiation.

### Part 2
Employed classification models such as SVM and random forests in Python to forecast monthly donor churn, prioritizing recall for model evaluation.
