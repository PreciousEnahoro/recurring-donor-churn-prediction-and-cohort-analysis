# sustainer-retention-analysis
Sustainer Retention Analysis work done at COC

The aim of this analysis is to investigate trends in the retention rate of sustainers, especially after observing how our sustainers drop off. Currently, only about 30% of sustainers are still retained 2 years after their recurring donation started. 

The goal is that the actions implemented as a result of this analysis would help the Digital Fundraising Team raise more money by improving the retention rate of sustainers.
