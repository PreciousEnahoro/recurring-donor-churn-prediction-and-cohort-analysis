# Sustainer Retention Analysis
The aim of this analysis is to investigate trends in the retention rate of sustainers (i.e recurring donors). Currently, only about 30% of sustainers are still retained 2 years after their recurring donation started. 

The goal is that the actions implemented as a result of this analysis would help the Digital Fundraising Team raise more money by improving the retention rate of sustainers.
